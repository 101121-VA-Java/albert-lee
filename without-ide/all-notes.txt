        Naming Conventions in Java
            - PascalCase for ClassName/InterfaceName
            - camelCase for methodName/variableName
            - reverse url for package declaration: com.revature.tranhuu
            - can't be reserved keywords

        Arrays
            - groups of elements of the same datatype, can be primitives or objects
            - Arrays are contiguous blocks in memory and as such the size of an array must be specified when initialized
            - Elements in an array can be selected using their index, index starts at 0
                - arrays have a property called "length"
                    - represents the length of an array
                    - .length
            - boolean[] bools = {true, false, true}; 
            - boolean[] bools = new boolean[3];

        Conditional Operators:
            - &, | - bitwise operator: evaluates both sides
            - &&, || - short circuit operators: evaluates one side if enough

        Ternary operator
            - shorthand version of an if statement
            - [expression to be evaluated] ? [ if True ] : [if False];

        Packages
            - group items based on what they do/ provide logical structure
                - separation of concerns:
                    - a package to hold all models/entities
                    - a package to hold all classes related to data persistence
                    - a package to hold all classes related to business logic (services)
                    - a package to hold all classes to interact with the web 
            - are declared at the top of the class
                - follows the reverse URL format/ reverse domain name
                - package com.revature.models;
            - folder structure
                - allows for resolution of naming conflicts
                - define access (access modifiers)
                    - how classes can access one another

        Class
            - Blueprint for object, defines states and behaviors
                - states refer to field, properties
                - behaviors refer to methods
                - objects can be instantiated using the new keyword which calls the constructor
            - Constructors
                - special method that has no return type and are used to create an instance of a class
                - called using the "new" keyword
                - default constructor: a no args-constructor provided by the compiler if NO OTHER CONSTRUCTOR IS PROVIDED (No args or parameterized)
                - no-args constructor: constructor with no parameter
                - parameterized/overloaded constructor: constructor with one or more parameters

        Exercise:
        - create model with at least 2 states and 1 behavior.
        - create a no args constructor and a parameterized constructor
        - test it out in a separate file with a main method
        - push it to github

        String
            - reference type, array of characters
            - String is a class, the strings that we're working with are instances of that class
            - immutable - cannot be changed, value of a string remains the same (final keyword)
            - Strings are usually stored in the String pool (in the heap)
                - where all strings instantiated literally (ie: String s = "Hello";) are stored
                - this allows Java to reuse the save String for repeated valued strings
            - String newS = new String("Hello"); //Creates the string in the heap itself instead of in the String Pool
            - String s = "Hello"; //Creates the string in the String Pool, can be reused
            - interning
                - .intern() method - checks if a String is already in the String Pool and if it exists returns a reference to it,
                    else creates that string and returns that reference

        StringBuilder/ StringBuffer
            - mutable alternatives to Strings with methods that allow for manipulation
                - append, replace...
            - StringBuilder is not thread-safe - faster
            - StringBuffer is thread-safe - slower

        Scanner
            - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html
            - Class in java that can be used to "scan" through several things
                - files, console inputs, input streams
            - can parse through inputs for different types, read an entire line... etc.
            - Recommendation: use one scanner per input stream 
            - Good practice: close resources when no longer needed

        OOP
            - Programming paradigm which relies on classes and objects to model real world objects
            - 4 pillars of OOP
                - Encapsulation
                - Inheritance
                - Polymorphism
                - Abstraction

        Class
            - Blueprint for an object, define their states and behaviors
            - Members of a class
                - variables and methods of that class
                    - Object/Instance
                        - Instance variables
                        - Instance methods
                    - Class/Doesn't belong to a specific object
                        - Static variables
                        - Static methods

        Object
            - Instance of a class
                - can be created using the "new" keyword
                    - ClassName varName = new ClassName();// invokes the no-args constructor for ClassName
                    - ClassName varName = new ClassName(someVar);// invokes the parameterized constructor for ClassName
            - Beware of the Object class
                - Parent of all classes
                    - contains methods such:
                        - toString() - override to return a String representation of an object
                        - equals(...) - override to actually compare the fields of the instances

        Encapsulation
            - refers to the ability for an object to protect its states and its behaviors
            - can be achieved by defining accessibility of classmembers using access modifiers
                - setting variables to private
            - using setters and getters to retrieve/change the states of an object

        Access modifiers
            - specify which classes have access to a class and its members
                - DO NOT CONFUSE WITH SCOPES
                - public - least restrictive, all the classes within the application have access
                - protected - all of the classes within the package and all of the sub/child classes have access
                - "default"/none (none is defined, if left blank) - all of the classes within the package have access
                    - NOTE: THE DEFAULT KEYWORD IS USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE 
                - private - the most restrictive, only the class itself has access

        Create Task.class
            - String name
            - LocalDate dueDate
            - encapsulate the class
            - create setter and getter
                - manually write at least one of them
            - give a toString() and a .equals() method
    Day 8, October 20, 2021
    Polymorphism and inheritance - 
            Inheritance
            - subclasses/children classes adopting states and behaviors from a parent/super class
            - deriving classes allows for code reusability and more efficient development
                - DRY - Do not repeat yourself - principle
            - keyword "extends"
                - by default/implicitely every class extends the Object class
            - by default the first line of every constructor is a call the the parent's constructor (super())
                - super is a keyword that refers to the parent class
                    - can access states and behaviors from the parent class dependending on the access modifer
                - this vs super
                - this - refers to the current instance
                - super - refers to the parent
            - Java does not support multiple inheritance
                - diamond problem

        Polymorphism
            - refers to the ability of objects and methods to adapt their behaviors in different contexts
                - can occur at compile time or at runtime
            - method overloading
                - HAPPENS WITHIN THE SAME CLASS
                - creating multiple methods in the same class with the same method name
                    but with different number and/or type(s) of parameters
                - can change the return type as well
                - compile time/static polymorphism
            - method overriding
                - write a method in a subclass with the same method signature as in the parent class 
                    but with a different implementation
                - ie: overriding the toString() method to be relevant to the subclass
                - can add @Override
                - runtime polymorphism
            - covariance return types
                - when Overriding a method, there is an option to change the return type
                    - the new return type would have to be a child/subtype of the original type
            - upcasting/downcasting
                - upcasting refers to instantiating/assigin a child by declaring its parent's reference type
                    - Task t = new BoringTask();
                    - this restricts the available methods to the methods declared in the parent class
                        however when a method is called, it calls the child's implementation
                - downcasting refers to instiating/ assigning an object by declaring its child class as a reference type
                    - BoringTask bt = (BoringTask) new Task();
                    - leads to issue, please avoid doing that
    Day 9, October 21, 2021
    Abstraction, non-access modifiers, exceptions - 
        Abstraction - 
            - a way to hide complex implementation behind a simple interface
                - using methods without actually know how they're implememented
            - in Java, abstraction is used via the abstract and the interface keywords
                - "abstract" keyword - non access modifier
                    - can be found in front of a class
                        - [access mod] abstract class [ClassName] {}
                        - means that the class cannot be instatiated
                            - cannot create an object of the abstract class
                            - like template that pushes a user to use more specific CONCRETE(non-abstract) child classes
                        - abstract classes can be inherited
                        - can have abstract methods
                            - Concrete (non-abstract) classes cannot have abstract methods
                                - ie: if an abstract method is present, the class has to be abstract
                            - Abtract classes can have 0 or more abstract methods
                    - can be found in front of a method
                        - [accessMod] abstract [returnType] [methodName]([params]);
                            - method without a body/implementation
                                - method is left to be implemented later (ie: child classes/ interface implementing classes)
                        - abstract methods cannot be private
                    - cannot be found in front of a variable  
                - "interface" keyword
                    - declares behavior(s) for classes to implement
                        - contract like
                        - a class can implement as many interfaces as desired
                    - convention dictates that interface should end the name with "-able"
                    - every method declared in an interface is going to be implicitely public abstract
                        - void doSomething();
                        - implicitely: public abstract void doSomething();
                    - can have variables
                        - variables must be public static final(cannot be changed)
                            - basically a constant
                            - implicit to interfaces
                    - interfaces can extend one another
                    - Types of interfaces
                        - Marker interfaces
                            - interfaces with no methods
                            - used to provide information to the compiler and JVM
                        - Functional interfaces
                            - interfaces with 1 methods
                            - can use lambda expressions
                        - regular interfaces
                            - any interface
                    - In java 8 the "default" keyword was introduced
                        - to provide default implementation to methods in interfaces in needed

        non-access modifiers
            - abstract
            - default
            - static
                - associated with a class rather than with an instance
                    - call the method/property using the classname instead of an instance
                - in front of a method
                - in front of a field
            - final
                - in front of a class
                    - [access mod] final class [ClassName]{}
                    - the class cannot be extended
                - in front of a field
                    - [access mod] final [varType] [varName];
                    - indicates that a variable/field cannot reassigned once initialized
                - in front of a method
                    - [access mod] final [returnType] [methodName]([params]){}
                    - indicates that the method cannot be overriden
                        - makes sure that all subclasses/children classes keep that implementation
            - synchronized
                - has to do with threads
                - only one thread can access a resource at a time

        Exception
        - represents a condition that prevents a method from completing successfully
        - an object created from the Exception class and its subclasses
            - inherits from the Throwable class
        - Error vs Exception
            - Error
                - extends from the Throwable class
                - identifies internal errors that cannot be recovered from
                    - StackOverflowError, NoClassDefFoundError
                - bad practice to try to handle those
            - Exception
                - divided into 2 types of exceptions
                    - Checked/Compile time exceptions
                        - "compiler-time exceptions", cannot compile the code until handled
                        - Exception and its subclasses EXCEPT RuntimeException and its subclasses
                        - 
                    - Unchecked/Runtime exceptions
                        - arises from coding errors/ can usually be prevented using some kind of validation
                            - ie: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, Arithmetic Exception...
                        - not checked by the compiler
                        - HAS TO BE a RuntimeException or a children of that class
            - IMPORTANT NOTE:
                - ALL EXCEPTIONS ARE THROWN/OCCUR AT RUNTIME
                - Compile time exception require exception handling logic at compile time
        - Exception Handling
            - Try block
                - used to encapsulate any statements that may throw an exception
            - Catch block 
                - used to provide an exception handling behavior
                    - specific logic/behavior to be executed if an exception of a certain type is caught
                    - catch (ExceptionType1 | ExceptionType2 e){
                        // behavior to handle
                    } catch (Exception e){
                        // behavior to handle any exception
                    }
                        - can catch multiple types in the same block if siblings on the hierarchy
                        - have multiple catch blocks, from most specific to least specific exception type
                            - otherwise the most generic exception will catch all
            - finally block
                - executes regardless of the outcome
                    - whether an exception is thrown or not
                - the way to skip a finally block is by using
                    - System.exit(0);
                - usually used to free up resources
            - try with resources
                - allows a resource to be closed without requiring a finally block
                - resource must implement the AutoCloseable interface
            - throws
                - use in the method signature "throws [ExceptionType]"
                - if there is not enough info to handle an exception properly at the time it's thrown
                    - let Java know that the exception will be handled by the calling method
        - Throwing Exception
            - "throw new [ExceptionType]();"
        - Custom Exception
            - can create a custom exception in java by extending Exception or its subclasses
                - to create a runtime/unchecked exception, extend from RuntimeException or a children of that class
                - to create a compiletime/checked exception, extend from Exception and its subclasses EXCEPT RuntimeException and its subclasses

    Java Memory Management
	- Automatic memory management
	- Stack
		- Datastructure that follows a LastInFirstOut pattern (LIFO) 
		- stores primitives and reference variables
		- each thread gets its own stack
		- variables "pop off" the stack once the scope the method is over 
	- Heap
		- Object storage
			- almost anything that's not a primitive is an object
		- String pool
			- special place in the heap to store String literals for reusability
		- shared by all the threads
			- can lead to concurrency issues if not managed properly
		- managed by the garbage collector

	- Pass By Value 
		- means that passing a variable into a method uses the value itself rather than the variable passed in
			- passing a reference variable in a method passes the reference value of the location in the heap and as such changes made to the object are persisted
	- Garbage collection
		- frees up memory/resources once they are no longer referenced
		- Garbage Collector is a daemon thread
			- thread that runs in the background
			- removes objects without references in the heap
				- finalize() 
					- last method called upon an object before it is garbage collected
					- people don't really use this anymore
			- garbage collection cannot be forced, but it can be suggested
				- System.gc();

    Casting
        - converting a datatype to another (int to a long)
            - implicit: if the original datatype has a smaller size than the target datatype (ie: int to long)
            - explicit: if the original datatype has a larger size than the target datatype (ie: long to int)
                - int i = (int) [long];
    Wrapper classes
        - way to treat primitive datatypes as objects
            - Autoboxing: Automatic conversion of a primitive to its wrapper class
            - AutoUnboxing: Automatic conversion of a wrapper class into its primitive

            .gitignore
            - notice that it starts with "." so it's a hidden file
                - to create can do > touch .gitignore
            - defines files and file extensions to not be tracked by git
                - NOTE: if the file already exists, it will not get deleted but won't updated anymore
                    - have to delete from the repository manually
            - generating .gitignore files:
                - https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/
                - As of now:
                    - Eclipse
                    - Mac
                    - Java
                    - Maven
                    - VsCode
                    - IntelliJ

        Datastructures
            - solutions to interact/work with data in our applications
                - answers to problems such as
                    - dynamic lists
                    - unique values only
                    - ordering

        Collection (I)
            - is an interface that can be considered the "super" interface, or the parent interface of all collections
                - while it extends iterable, Collection declares methods availables in all collections
                    - add();
                    - remove();
                    - contains();
                    - size();
            - collections only work with objects
                - need to work with wrapper classes for primitives
            - Collection interface should not be confused with the Collections class
                - Collections WITH AN S is a class that provides utility methods to work with collections 
            - Extends iterable, what allows collectiosn to be iterated over/ use an iterator

        List (I)
            - is an interface that extends Collection, that can hold duplicate values
            - Concrete implementations of List
                - ArrayList (C)
                    - Dynamically sized array in which elements can be added and removed
                    - ArrayLists leverage indexes which make them more efficient for retrieval operations
                - LinkedList (C)
                    - Consists of a series of nodes which store data and a reference to the next node
                    - LinkedList are better for insertion and deletion operations
        Set (I)
            - is an interface that extends Collection, does not hold duplicate values
            - Concrete implementations
                - HashSet
                    - that cannot promise order (leverages hashcode)
                    - leverages a HashMap in the background
                - TreeSet
                    - ordered
                        - by default follows "natural ordering"
                            - can specify custom order using Comparator/Comparable
        Queue (I)
            - is an interface that extends Collection, generally it follows a FIFO order (First In First Out)
            - Concrete implementations
                - Priority Queues
                    - Ordered by priority
                - Linked List
                    - implements both List and Queue
            - Come in with special methods unique to queues
                - peek
                - poll

        Map (I)
            - is an interface that does NOT extend Collection, leverage a key value pair system
                - it does not extend iterable and there cannot be iterated the traditional way 
                - comes with its own set of methods
            - Concrete implementations
                - HashMap
                    - hashcode: 
                        - method that provides a hash value based on the fields of an object
                            - objects that are equals should return the same hashcode
                            - objects that are not equals may return the same hashcode
                                - a good hashcode implementation should try to produce distinct integers for unequal objects
                        - this value is stored internally to store data in a Map and to improve access operation
                - TreeMap
                    - A map that is ordered 

        Comparable
            - functional interface
                - compareTo method
            - implement in the model class itself
                - should return an integer that will be used to define an order
                    - if integer is negative, is of lesser value
                    - if integer is positive, is of greater value
                    - if integer is 0, objects are of equal value
            - used to define a natural order
        Comparator
            - functional interface
                - compare method
            - implement in a different class
                - Comparator for an object
            - used to define a custom order

    Multithreading
	- refers to dealing with applications with concurrent processes
		- these sub-processes/ path of executions are referred to as threads
	- priority
		- defines the order in which threads can access a synchronized resource
			- resource that can only be accessed by one thread at a time
		- threads with higher priority get first dibs over other threads
			- can lead to concurrency issues
	- types of threads
		- User-defined threads
			- JVM ensures their execution to completion
				- ie: main method - main thread
		- Daemon threads
			- "optional"
			- lower in priority
			- run in the background
				- ie: gc
		- each thread gets their own stack but all threads share the same heap

    Creating and running threads in Java
        - extends the Thread class
        - implements the Runnable interface
            - preferred way
        - override the run() method
            - to specify the behavior for a thread
        - instantiate a thread object and invoke the start() method on that thread
            - start() method creates a new thread and invoke the run() on it
            - otherwise if run() is called without start, it will just be executed on the main thread

    States of a thread
        - New
            - created a thread object, run() hasn't been called yet
        - Runnable
            - run() has been called and is executing
        - Blocked
            - waiting for another thread to be done accessing a resource on which a lock has been placed (synchronized keyword)
                - synchronized prevents more than one thread at a time to access a resource
        - Waiting
            - wait()
                - waiting for notify/notifyAll()
            - join()
                - stops the execution of a thread until another thread is done executing
        - Timed-waiting
            - sleep()
                - wait a certain amount of time
        - Terminated
            - everything has been executed

    Concurrency issues
        - starvation
            - lower priority threads not being able to access a resource because higher priority threads keep taking them
        - deadlock
            - occurs when the waiting process is still holding on to another resource that the first needs before it can finish.

    Lambda expressions
        - allows for a compact expression of instances of single method class
            - implements a functional interface without require a whole new class to do so
                - ie: Runnable, run method
        - syntax
            - [interfaceName] [objectName] = ()->[return value];
            - [interfaceName] [objectName] = ([params])->[return value];
            - [interfaceName] [objectName] = ([params])->{
                // code goes here
              };

    Log4J2
	- Java Logging Framework, successor of Log4J
	- Logging consists in capturing and persisting information regarding the state of an application
		- making it available at a later time for analysis
	- Main components
		- Loggers
			- responsible for recording log events and forwarding them to the appropriate appender(s)
			- a root logger is provided by default - getRootLogger()
				- usually class specific loggers are preferred
		- Appenders
			- responsible for delivering log events to their destination targets
			- formatting of the event is delegated to a layout
		- Layouts
			- responsible for returning a byte array to be turned into a String using the appropriate layout
	- Logging levels
		- Trace
			- debug message, used to capture the flow through out the application
				- identify a specific part for debugging
		- Debug
			- debug message for a general debug event/ some information that might be helpful to debug
		- Info
			- identify general event
		- Warning
			- identify an event that might lead to an error
		- Error
			- identify error occuring during app, potentially recoverable
		- Fatal
			- identify a server error that prevents an app from continuing its execution
